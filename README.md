# MIGRATE EXCEL TO AWS

This was a my personal tool created to move data from an Excel sheet. The project has three main goals:

1. Move data from an Excel sheet to an EC2 server.
2. Upload a CV from Google Drive to an S3 bucket.
3. Send an email to the relevant mail using SES.

Please note that this project was designed for a specific task and is not expandable. Feel free to explore the code and use the source code as you wish.

Initially, this project was under a private license. After the expiration of that license, it is now licensed under the MIT license.
